This module is currently under development. The expected features are driven by the requirements
of hosting sites on two different Amazon Regions. For this reason much of the lookup and display
focuses on using the rapid response times of the route 53 dns servers. So for now there is no
caching involved.

There are existing web interfaces that provide this, but not without having to provide a third
party my AWS ID and Key. Which seems to be just asking for issues down the road. 

This code uses the PHP class setup written by Dan Myers. All hail Dan. Do not mod the r53.php
head or license info.

Coming Features:

1. backup and record specific history - We have found that while it is nice to push a given
site between AWS regions, it would be very nice to have a history of changes to a given Zone
entry. 

2. batch script - We would like the ability to update a number of entries for a given zone. We
expect that during server issues, like a zone availability issue in once region, we want to
migrate all the sites to a different region, maybe for a limited time. Once the cloud is resolved
we want the ability to roll back the dns changes and get the sites back where we were. Without
having to review each site by hand.

3. Drush integration is planned but not real priority.
